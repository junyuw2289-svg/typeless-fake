## 3. How It Works

**Section Headline:** Three seconds to better writing

**Section Subheadline:** one% runs quietly in the background. When you need it, it's already there.

### Step 1: Speak naturally
Talk the way you normally would. one% captures your voice in real time and handles filler words, pauses, and corrections automatically.

### Step 2: AI cleans it up
Your raw speech gets transformed into clear, structured text. one% detects the app you're in and adjusts tone and formatting to match.

### Step 3: Text appears instantly
Polished text lands directly in your active window — Slack, Gmail, Notion, VS Code, or any of 100+ supported apps. No clipboard, no middleman.

## 4. Core Features (Big 3)

### Smart Dictation
one% doesn't just transcribe — it thinks. Filler words vanish. Rambling sentences get tightened. Your "um, so basically what I'm trying to say is" becomes a clean, direct statement. It's like having an editor who works at the speed of sound.

### Context-Aware Formatting
Drafting a Slack message and a client email require different tones. one% knows the difference. It detects which app you're in and automatically adjusts formality, structure, and formatting — casual in Slack, professional in Gmail, technical in VS Code.

### 100+ Languages
Speak in English, switch to Mandarin mid-sentence, throw in some Spanish — one% keeps up. It auto-detects languages in real time with no manual switching. Built for the way multilingual people actually communicate.

## 8. FAQ

**Q: How is this different from built-in dictation on my Mac or PC?**
A: Built-in dictation gives you a raw transcript — every "um," awkward pause, and run-on sentence included. one% uses AI to clean, restructure, and format your speech into polished text. It also adapts tone based on the app you're using, something no built-in tool does.

**Q: Does one% store or send my voice data anywhere?**
A: No. Voice processing happens locally on your device. We have zero data retention — your audio is never stored, transmitted, or used for training. Your privacy isn't a feature we market. It's a constraint we build around.

**Q: Which apps does one% work with?**
A: one% injects text directly into any app that accepts keyboard input — Slack, Gmail, Notion, VS Code, Google Docs, Microsoft Word, iMessage, WhatsApp, and 100+ more. If you can type in it, one% works in it.

**Q: Can I really mix languages mid-sentence?**
A: Yes. one% auto-detects language switches in real time. You can start a sentence in English, drop into French, and finish in Japanese — no manual toggling required. It supports 100+ languages.

**Q: How accurate is the transcription?**
A: one% achieves 99.2% accuracy across supported languages in standard conditions. The custom dictionary feature lets you add specialized terms, names, and jargon to push accuracy even higher for your specific use case.

**Q: What happens if I hit the free tier limit?**
A: At 4,000 words per week, most casual users never hit the cap. If you do, you can upgrade to Pro for unlimited words at $12/month — or just wait for the weekly reset. We don't cut you off mid-sentence.
